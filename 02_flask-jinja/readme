there are replacement fields in the template file, which are replaced by the arguments in app.py's render_template call

q0: it will throw an error saying render_template is not defined
q1: http://127.0.0.1/my_foist_template
q2: 1st argument is template file in /templates; other arguments are field replacements in html file

commands in jinja2 use {%...%} instead of normal fields: {{... }}
- for
- endfor

for loops called this way can also include replacement fields

newlines in HTML can be created with <br>
