1. We must have beginPath() for the circle to be drawn properly, or else it'll look like nothing was cleared off the canvas
2. If we reassign requestID every time we click the button, then we will need to get rid of the last requestID generated by our request, or else we will essentially run multiple loops with requestAnimationFrame, making it seem like the circle changes increasingly faster.
3. Canvas should always be cleared BEFORE you draw a shape (and increment its value)
