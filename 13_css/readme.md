# Team Whatever: Elizabeth, Maya, Anthony
DISCO:
* We can use the color picker to match HEX codes to the colors seen on the sample page, instead of guessing with RBG values.
* "Display: flex;"  allows us to vertically align group elements
* Grids allow us horizontally position blocks


QCC:
* Is there another way, except using a grid, to divide the website into sections?
* Is there any difference between using internal, external, and inline css execution wise (even though they display in same way)?
