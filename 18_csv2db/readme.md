DISCO:
- open file with: with open(file) as f
    - do not have to close file, more compact than longer way
- drop table if exists prevents duplicate tables and errors


QCC
- how do we get key values from DictReader?
- what is the advantage of using DictReader vs just reader?
- why does c.execute ("select * from students") not print content? why do we have to use fetchone or fetchall?
