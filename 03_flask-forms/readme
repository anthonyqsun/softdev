user arguments taken through GET requests are params in URL
usernames don't save in dict - one at a time

after uncommenting lines 42 and 43, the page threw an error. Going to the url http://127.0.0.1:5000/?username=foo solved this issue, as it had a username arg to print.

print(request.args['username']) prints the username we inputted to the terminal


QCC:
what does methods= get, post do?
How can we save the usernames?
